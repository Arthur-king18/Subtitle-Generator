## User requirements:
The client needed a personal subtitle generator that could work offline. One of the requirements was maximum ease of use and minimal computer processing power. 

## My solution:
I solved this problem using Node.js. This, combined with a pre-trained AI model, allowed me to achieve a simple interface, a wide range of settings, offline operation, and most importantly: the program uses minimal computer resources, making it incredibly fast.
